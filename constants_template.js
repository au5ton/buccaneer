PART A

For the *host* value, put the IP address of Fluff World. I hope you know what that is.

PART B

Navigate to Fluff World and log in. 
If you're on Chrome, press Ctrl + Shift + J. 
If you're on another browser, figure out how to open the console by Googling.
Once you have the console open, type `document.cookie` and press Enter.
Copy and paste what is inside the quotes to the `cookie` value above.
